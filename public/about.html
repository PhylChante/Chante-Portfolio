<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Phyllis Tumusiime aka Chante and I am a female Ugandan aged 30. I have recently taken an interest in Web Development and I began my journey to become a Fullstack Developer last week. I am excited to learn the new skills involved in Web Development; and although I know it will not be smooth sailing, I am willing to stick it out until the very end.</p>
<p>The reason I am doing this course is I have a brilliant business idea which requires me to have these skills in order to set up a website and web app that is both functional and attractive to the users that will visit the app. In addition, we live in a quickly changing world especially technologically and web development skills are increasingly becoming critical to navigate and keep up with the technological advancement of the world.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to see how this page grows and develops and evolves with every new section that I cover in the course. At the moment, I have only covered intermediate html. I can't wait to see how other programming languages will contribute to how this website and my portfolio at large will develop.</p>
<p>Looking forward to walking this journey with you. Thanks for being a part of this.</p>
